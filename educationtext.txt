I enrolled into ChongZheng Primary School in 2006. I got to go on a school trip to Perth in 2011. I got appointed "Green Captain" and "Root Guardian" back then, and they were essentially roles of the student councils. I graduated CZPS with an aggregate of 200 in 2012. I was in 2 CCAs, Rugby and Infocomm Club.
I enrolled into Loyang Secondary School in 2013 and I had a blast being in the school. I believe that this school built my character into what it really is today, on top of that, I managed to go on a school trip to Japan in 2015 and I graduated LYSS in 2016 with L1R4 of 12 and L1R5 of 15 alongside of being a Vice-Captain of the CrossCountry
I enrolled into Singapore Polytechic in 2017 into a Course called Infomation Technology. I'm having a great time in Polytechnic, I have so much freedom to spend more time with friends and play games but obviously I have to also balance out work too so that's a bummer. Currently still studying in this school as of 2018.
